I have been using Cursor, which is a fork of VS Code, to help me minimize "handcoding" for the iP. 

In my experience, it is much better than the AI assistance on IDEA, as well as Github Copilot. For most increments, it suffices to give it a description from the course website and it requires no prompt engineering, and minimal editing afterwards.
